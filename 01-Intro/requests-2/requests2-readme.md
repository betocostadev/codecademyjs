In the previous lesson, we spent a lot of time dealing with asynchronous data (remember AJAX/ Asynchronous JavaScript And XML?). Many of our web page interactions rely on asynchronous events, so managing these events is essential to good web development.

To make asynchronous event handling easier, *promises* were introduced in JavaScript in ES6:

- [Mozilla Development Network: Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)

A promise is an object that handles asynchronous data. A promise has three states:

*pending* : when a promise is created or waiting for data.
*fulfilled* : the asynchronous operation was handled successfully.
*rejected* : the asynchronous operation was unsuccessful.

The great thing about promises is that once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, you can chain an additional method to the original promise.

In this lesson, we will explain how to use `fetch()`, which uses promises to handle requests. Then, we will simplify requests using `async` and `await`.

Weâ€™ll use the Datamuse API for GET requests and Rebrandly URL Shortener API for POST requests. If you don't already have a Rebrandly API, check the requests1-readme.md to create one.
