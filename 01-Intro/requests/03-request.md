# CodeCademy Introduction To JavaScript

### REQUESTS I

## XHR GET Requests II

#### File: 03-request.js

We are going to reconstruct XHR GET request boilerplate code step-by-step until we have written a complete GET request.

Feel free to refer to the XHR GET diagram at any point while completing this exercise:

- [XHR GET diagram](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/intermediate-javascript-requests/diagrams/XHR+GET+diagram.svg)

1. First, we need to create the `XMLHttpRequest` object using the `new` operator. Save this object in a `const` called `xhr`.

Note: While the code will work regardless of how you name your variables, it is a common practice to name this object `xhr`.

2. Next, save the following URL to a `const` called `url`. Make sure the URL is wrapped in quotes so that it is a string.

```
https://api-to-call.com/endpoint
```

3. Set the `responseType` property of the `xhr` object to equal `'json'`.

JSON is JavaScript Object Notation, which is how the response is going to be formatted.

4. Set the `xhr.onreadystatechange` event handler equal to an anonymous arrow function. Leave the function empty.

5. In the code block of the function you created in the previous step, add this conditional statement:

```
if (xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {

}
```

The purpose of this conditional statement checks to see if the request has finished.

6. In the code block of the conditional statement, return the `response` property of `xhr`.

7. Below the function you created in the previous two steps, call the `.open()` method on the `xhr` object and pass it `'GET'` and `url` as arguments.

`.open()` creates a new request and the arguments passed in determine the type and URL of the request.

8. On the following line, call the `.send()` method on the `xhr` object. Do not pass it any arguments.

Nice work! Youâ€™ve written the boilerplate code for an AJAX `GET` request using an `XMLHttpRequest` object.
